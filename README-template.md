## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was one of the more extensive React projects I've undertaken. I decided on React for this project because of the ease of use for state. It was interesting that the most difficult part of the project for me was the styling. 

I think this project has really helped me build my React skills. 

### Continued development

I'd love to come back again to this in a few months or years and see how I can improve my code.
